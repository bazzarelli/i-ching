        overview: `This is the kua of creating yourself as an individual or of creating some idea that you have conceived. Receiving this kua is indeed a blessing, for this is the kua of Heaven, in which all the lines are strong, good, and virtuous, and it guarantees sublime success from the primal depths of the Universe, provided that you act in accordance with its provisions. It is rare to receive this kua as an answer, but when you do, you are faced with an opportunity of the greatest magnitude. When your success is guaranteed from the primal depths of the Universe, it means that even the spiritual world will come to your aid and that blessings will be heaped upon you. Confucius, the great Chinese sage and I Ching scholar, said that when Heaven blesses us, it helps us, and to be helped by Heaven is to be helped indeed.\nHowever, to achieve the success you seek you must act with the utmost integrity and honor. This means putting yourself in accord with the six lines of this kua, all of which are pure, light-giving, powerful, and just.\nIf you do not, the enormous potential promised by this kua will not be achieved. Examine yourself closely to see if you have any bad habits or bad intentions that could potentially hurt yourself or your plan. If you find areas in your character that can be improved, start the corrective work immediately. That is the key to unlocking your full potential and the full potential of your plan or of what you are conceiving.\nBecause this kua unfolds over time, it also requires perseverance and endurance: perseverance in a course of action that is right, good, and just; and endurance to see things through to the end. If you act with complete integrity and honor, you will bring into existence the full power of this kua and experience sublime success. You will fulfill this kua’s great promise: you will mount to the skies of success as though on the wings of six dragons!`,

        overview: `Sublime success will come to you if you are willing to follow good advice, are open and receptive to new information, yield to others’ ideas and wishes, follow wise leaders who have worthy goals, work hard, cooperate, and avoid taking on leadership. If you try to lead, you will go astray and will fail to achieve the sublime success promised in this kua. Seek out like-minded people to help you, and, if you find them, join with them or have them join with you, but do not attempt to lead them. If you must carry on alone, do so, but seek guidance all the same.\nYou will enjoy the sublime success promised by this kua only if you adhere strictly to its attributes, which are receptive, yielding, submissive, and willing to follow. Avoid arrogance. The Universe supports those who are modest and brings down those who are arrogant. If you are the leader, fulfill your duties of leadership, but not without following the advice of those who can offer you wise counsel. Seek information from every source, ask for help, and trust your advisors. This is a time when following rather than leading will benefit you most. The success promised by this kua is “sublime,” meaning that it is not only success in terms of abundance, but also success that is endowed with greatness of spirit and therefore benefits the whole of the people.`,

In the beginning, everything needed for complete fulfillment is present but not yet in its proper place, so a state of confusion exists. It is not necessary that you have everything you need at the outset, for at the appointed time, it will all come: money, helpers, events, material assistance, and opportunities. The only necessity is your firm determination to reach your goal.\nHere at the beginning, danger is present, so avoid taking immediate action. You must wait, and, during this waiting period, seek out helpers. Also, use this time to organize and develop a plan that you can begin to follow, but remain open and willing to rework it if you find that it needs adjustment. By proceeding in that manner, you will avert danger. You will also bring order out of the confusion of this time of beginning and will thus manifest supreme success.`,

        overview: `When inexperienced persons seek guidance from experienced teachers, they meet with success because it is the teacher's joy and responsibility to teach others. It is important, though, that students have the right attitude toward their teachers. These are some basic guidelines that will help.\nFirst, students must say that they are inexperienced and need guidance.\nSecond, they should be modest and show the teacher proper respect.\nThird, they should never mistrustfully question the teach more than once abvout the same question. However, if the answer is truly not understood, additional questions are permissable. Following these simple steps will make the teacher happy to cooperate, and thus the student will continue to learn. This then becomes an amazing time for the students because they can learn the great words of wisdom and become an expert in their chosen field. That is how teachers lead their students to success.\n If you are the teacher and your students continue to doubt your answers or do not show you the respect you deserve, it is wise to abandon your efforts. Some people are not ready to listen to the wise words of a sage. Instead, let them go out in the world, where the Universe will give them what they need for their learning. Over time, they will be molded, shaped, and changed to the point where they will be more willing to listen. There is no saying how long this will take, for it is different with everyone.\nThis kua offers advice for both students and teachers. You must think about the question you asked and decide which one you are. Once you have decided, follow the guidance appropriate for your role.`,

The correct action is to wait until the danger passes, for to advance in the face of such danger would be foolhardy. Because the lower trigram, which represents you, is composed of three strong, solid lines, you will ultimately be successful, provided you remain true to the nature of the three solid lines, which are light- giving, pure, and virtuous.\nIf you fail to wait, the danger that looms will overwhelm you, and you will not attain your goal. However, after the time of waiting is past, you will benefit from moving toward your goal again. During this time of waiting, you should refine your plans, enjoy relaxation and recreation, maintain a joyous and promising outlook, and remain unconcerned, knowing that you will ultimately reach your goal. Do not waste this time in empty hoping. Instead, let yourself be filled with the inner certainty that ultimate success lies ahead. If you allow yourself to doubt, you will only fall prey to worry, anxiety, and fear- filled imaginings about the future, all of which will be damaging to your future success and will cause you stress. Be confident that you will reach your goal, and you will enjoy happy, peaceful thoughts and will engage in useful activities, both of which lead directly to success. By acting in accordance with what is highest and best within you will you achieve success and good fortune.`,

Each member brings strength to the group so that the group becomes strong and enduring.\nSome people may hesitate to join with you, but eventually you will win them over. If they wait too long to join with you, they will incur misfortune because they will have missed their opportunity. For the group to be successful, it requires that you provide clear - cut goals around which everyone can rally. As the leader, you must be steadfast in maintaining your intention to reach your goals, you must adhere to good values, you must be loyal to the group, and you must hold the best interests of the group uppermost in your mind. To hold your group together and to inspire them, it is important that you possess greatness of spirit, enthusiasm, a positive attitude, strength, and wisdom.\nLook to strengthening and improving your character so that you are always performing at optimum levels. Before you begin, inquire of the oracle again, and ask what you need to know to accomplish your goal. If you begin without being equal to the task, you will incur misfortune, and it would have been better for you and your followers that you had never attempted the union.\nIf you feel that you are not equal to the task, it will better for you to join some other organization or group of which you can be a part.

You may be the force, or it may be a group to which you belong. Your advance is being blocked by someone or something that is represented by the broken line in the fourth place. Because the fourth line is a weak, broken line, the force, which can be a person, group, or obstacle, is weak, and therefore, cannot permanently block you, but it can restrain your advance and hold it in check, though only for a short time. The brief period of holding back will be of great benefit because the future is being prepared for the time when you will be able to advance again. During this time of mild restraint, you should improve yourself in whatever ways you can so that when the gentle restraining force ceases, or you overcome it, you will be ready to move forward. If your question was about your taking action, the answer is that you should gently restrain yourself for the time being until a more appropriate time for advance appears.`,

The key to your success lies in cultivating a pleasing and sincere personality, which will bring you success and good fortune because the person or group represented by the tiger will trust and respect you. Pleasant manners win over even bad - tempered people. If you do not let their unpleasantness irritate or upset you, your own pleasant manners will have a positive and calming effect on them.

The two come together to form the condition of Heaven on Earth. \nWhat a wonderful time of perfect harmony this is! The light force is in the ascendancy, and the dark force is diminishing. People in high places are considerate of their subordinates, subordinates are helpful and respectful to those in power, feuds end, friendships are renewed, peace prevails, and pettiness ends. People act from their higher natures rather than from their lower. There is perfect correspondence in all areas, meaning that everyone is at peace with everyone else.

In addition to the abundance you already enjoy, you will have the opportunity to gain more, but for that to happen requires that you act in accord with what is highest and best within you and that you work to reach new heights of honor and integrity. By eliminating bad influences from your life and encouraging good ones, you will live in accord with the highest Universal principles, which bring supreme success because of the fulfillment of natural law. Many opportunities for advancement and gain will now come your way, but even the greatest opportunity will come to nothing if you do not handle it properly. If you have the opportunity to help an influential or highly placed friend, associate, or person, do so, for that will bring you great good fortune. To be a good caretaker of the abundance that has already come to you, be mindful of your conduct, remain modest, continue to behave with honor and integrity, share some of your abundance as you accumulate it, and counsel others when the opportunity presents itself.

        overview: `The course of action you are considering at this time will achieve a modest success. Be content with that, for, once it has come to you, any further effort to push it to greater heights will turn it into failure. This kua advises you not to brag, complain about your problems, or strive beyond your capabilities. Always reduce what is too much and add to what is too little. As a result, you will enjoy continued success and good fortune because the Universe always favors the modest and undermines the arrogant. Those who boast of their power, wealth, position, promotions, successes, or influential friends inevitably invite misfortune and humiliation. Boasting reveals only that you feel inferior, inadequate, and insecure, and that you are trying to inflate your own importance. Principled people believe who they are and what they have are enough, and they let those qualities or possessions speak for themselves. Such people always act modestly and thus assure their continued success.\nThis kua advises you to keep your goals modest and realistic. Otherwise, the small success possible for you at this time will turn into failure. If you attempt too much, you will end by succeeding in nothing.\nKeep in mind that, if you share the credit for your successes with others, your area of influence will grow. This is the kua of moderation, so avoid taking any extreme actions, for they will not benefit you. Walk the middle road to your success. Avoid extremes.\nThe ancient Chinese sages valued modesty and moderation above all other qualities of character and behavior. If you make boastful claims at the outset of a project, you will find it far more difficult to attain your goal successfully. If, on the other hand, you avoid extravagant claims or predictions, no resistance will arise against you.\nCultivate modesty, and your progress will be swift and sure because no one will feel resentment toward you. If you remain modest in spite of your merits and achievements, others will love and respect you, and you will win the support necessary to carry out even difficult and dangerous undertakings. If you make boastful claims, and then achieve only a moderate success that still falls short of your claims, people will say that you have failed.

You have received this kua because you have attracted the notice of a person or group with whom or with which you wish to establish a close relationship. If you continue to be enthusiastic, sincere, and thoughtful, the relationship will blossom. Because this is a time of following as well as leading, it is appropriate that you seek and follow the advice or guidance of another, even though he or she may be in a subordinate position. If you wish to rule, you must first learn to serve. Only in that way will you come to understand those who will eventually serve you. Because you understand them and their duties, you will not ask more of them than they can give, and you will know how to inspire them with enthusiasm and loyalty.\nThe only valid reason why you should want to rule is so you can better serve your followers. Unprincipled people seek to rule so they can wield power over and control others, but this leads to their downfall. If you are unprepared or unwilling to serve your followers, it is better for them and for you that you never become their leader, because, if you do, and then cease to serve them, they will abandon you. All your efforts will have been for naught, and you will suffer great humiliation. Only through serving your followers can you obtain from them the wholehearted assent necessary if they are to follow you. If you continue to follow the path of the superior person and to persevere in what is good, right, fair, and just, you will enjoy great benefits, and no one will resent or resist you. Because of the effort that this time of leading and following requires, be sure to rest, relax, and nourish yourself properly. Rest and activity must follow each other in proper order if you are to be successful at this time. Also, it is essential that you remain modest and share the credit for any goals you achieve.

        overview: `At this time, there is a great opportunity to take a major step forward. There is a deficiency in your situation that will be greatly to your advantage to correct. The deficiency may be psychological, having to do with beliefs you are holding that are not in accord with the truth of the situation, or it may be that some aspect of your external life requires improvement. The deficiency may include your physical health, your work, your love relationship, your business relationships and related business matters, your spiritual well - being, financial matters, or undertakings of any nature. The deficiencies most likely exist in the situation surrounding your question.\nRegarding psychological deficiencies, throughout your life until now, you have been taught lessons. Some of those lessons may not have been in accord with Universal law or truth. By acting in accord with those lessons, you may have brought misfortune your way. You may also have adopted behavior patterns that are not only not benefiting you, but are creating problems for you. When you begin correcting psychological conditions, asking those who know you well to sincerely tell you what improvements they think you could make will be of great benefit to you. Be open - minded about their suggestions, even though you may feel hurt or offended by what they say.\nClinging to past hurts and injuries is foolish, and is one of the most important inner conditions you can change. What happened is finished, even if it happened only yesterday. We cannot change past events, but we can change how we view them. If you are permitting events from your past to bring you pain today, you are the foolish one who is giving those events their power to hurt you. Whatever the event was, whether it hurt you, took something from you, betrayed you, violated you, or caused you mental or physical pain, it is over. It has no power to hurt you beyond that which you give it—and what you give, you can take away. Because you live in a Universe where everything that happens benefits you, continuing to carry hurts from the past shows that you lack true understanding of your Universe, and alerts you to an important deficiency that you can begin correcting immediately.\nThe feelings you hold in your mind manifest in your body. It is the nature of the mind to create, and what you hold there will somehow manifest itself in your body. If you hold worry and anxiety in your mind, they will appear in your body as pain, disease, stress, and illness. If you hold gratitude, joy, and reverence in your mind, they will manifest as glowing, radiant health. That you are consulting the I Ching at this time shows that you have already begun learning lessons that are in accord with Universal truth.\nIf you have a shortcoming that is obvious to you, or if there is an obvious deficiency in your situation, it is serious indeed and requires immediate attention. You must plan carefully if you are to reach your goal. Once you begin taking corrective measures, keep a careful eye on your progress so that regression does not set in. Through constant perseverance in healing the deficiency inherent within yourself or the situation, you will eventually reach your goal.\nAs the ancient text states, “Before the starting point, three days; after the starting point, three days.” This refers to the time you need to spend defining what you need to change, planning the changes, and continuing to be watchful as your plan unfolds. By being diligent in your efforts, and persevering until you reach your goal, you will enjoy supreme success and great good fortune.`,

To be tolerant, means to overlook others’ faults and mistakes. Overlook even intentional transgressions, for that will prevent arguments and ensure your continued success. During this time of rapid advance, be tireless in bringing your plans to completion. This is the time for action. Do not be fearful, for your success is certain. If you see a problem coming, you can neutralize it before it grows strong. However, if the setback does occur, do not be dismayed. In the end, it will work to your complete benefit, particularly if you act as if the only reason it has occurred was so that you could benefit.`,

        overview: `This kua takes its meaning from its visual resemblance to a tall tower. The four lower broken lines represent the legs, and the top two solid lines represent the platform. Standing on this tower, one can see far away and be seen from far away, which gives rise to the meaning of this kua, “Being Looked Up To as an Example.” The upper trigram, which symbolizes the gentle wind that blows over the earth and penetrates everywhere, suggests that inner and outer seeing should miss nothing. You are in a position to set a good example for others by the values you hold and the beneficial actions you take. When you act in accordance with Universal laws and what is highest and best within you, others will see clearly that your actions are in harmony with All - That - Is, and they will look up to you as a role model. They will also see you as a person worthy of loyalty and of being followed even into dangerous and difficult undertakings such as those indicated in the ancient phrase, “crossing the great water.” This is an opportunity for you to look inward to see whether you are fearless, brave, greathearted, loyal, kind, dedicated, consistent, honorable, gentle, and openhanded, or whether you are harboring any weak, unworthy, or selfish tendencies. This is an extraordinary time for you, for you can make great advances inwardly and outwardly, and you will find it easy to gather loyal followers.`,

        overview: `This kua depicts being punished and punishing others. Punishment should never be an end in itself, nor carried out to deliberately hurt another, but should be used only to guide someone back onto the path of correct behavior, what the ancient text refers to as “the path of the superior person.”\nCorrective punishment becomes necessary when we deviate from the path of abundant life, for the pitfalls we then experience will motivate us to return to the correct path. It is always beneficial to administer justice, which brings success. The best way to deter both wrongdoers and criminals is to make the law clear, and punishment swift and certain.\nIn the Universe, there is no lag time. Every action produces a result, and the result is always in exact accord with the action. No one can escape the corrective measures of the Universe, but remember, these measures are only for the benefit of the one who receives it. If you have received this kua, either you need and will receive corrective punishment, or another person needs it and you will provide it. Take heart, because corrective punishment is always for the complete benefit of the person on whom it is imposed, whether you or someone else.`,

It is through the refinement of the external aspects of your life that you will achieve your goal.\nRemember that the greatest beauty lies in the original form, not in its outer adornments. It is better to let the original form stand forth rather than attempt to beautify it with too much outer adornment. Be patient and persevering in maintaining your decision to refine the outward aspects of your life, and you will achieve your success and achieve that which you desire. By refining the outward aspects of your life, you will be able to succeed in the more controversial and complicated issues that you may have to face. This is a kua of success and indicates that refining the external aspects of your life will greatly benefit you. You will do best if you begin by setting and achieving small goals.`,

The best course of action, if the relationship is to be ended, is to end it harmoniously, which will prevent it from deteriorating further and will eliminate long - lasting ill will. Because you have received this kua in answer to your question, it means that the possibility of ending some type of relationship exists. If you wish for the relationship to continue, heeding the advice of this kua will help to preserve it. If the relationship in question involves an organization, group, or social structure of any kind, this kua indicates that its leader, who may be yourself, or those in authority are being undermined. Fortunately, you or they are of extraordinary integrity and, being at the top of the kua, still powerful. If you are a member of the undermining force, disassociate yourself from it at once. If you are the person being undermined, conduct yourself with complete honor, integrity, and generosity, for therein lies your strength and influence. You or your cause will benefit greatly if you offer help or assets to those below you. This generosity will help you to maintain your position of influence and power. No matter which of the above conditions are at issue here, you will weather this time of “Undermining, Overthrowing, or Ending a Relationship,” provided you are generous with those under you and persevere in fulfilling your duties and fulfilling your goals, and act only out of the purest of motives.`,

        overview: `The forces of light and dark, which represent good and evil, alternate constantly. An increase of one always leads to a decrease of the other. This kua indicates that the time of darkness is past, bringing the victory of the light that is now in the ascendancy. This is a time for you to look inward, to be in touch with the Divine within you, and to perceive your inner light, which is the ascending force of life in nature and in you. To sense that inner light is to experience your oneness with All - That - Is. The return of the light force brings great good fortune. Projects are blessed, relationships prosper, feuds end, friendships are reborn, and people are kinder and more thoughtful to each other. It is a time when people act from their higher natures rather than their lower. It is a time of rejoicing because the return of the light force brings with it the blessings of the Universe. You can magnify the influence of this time by striving to be the best person you can be. This kua indicates that success is forthcoming, that friends will come to your aid, and that having somewhere to go or something to do will enhance your position. Even superior persons, no matter how careful they are, sometimes stray from the path of light, which is the path of abundant life. It is crucial that you realize when you have strayed from that path and that you turn back before going too far because otherwise you will “fall into the pit, ” meaning that you will suffer misfortune.\nHaving received this kua, reflect on your character and your actions, as well as the results that you have achieved, to see if you have strayed from the right path that will bring you the best and greatest benefits. If your life is not unfolding as you wish, it can only be because you have strayed from the path of light and need to make basic inner changes. If you do, you will find your way back to the right path, where you will again find great good fortune.\nBecause the light force is just returning, be gentle with yourself and avoid trying to accomplish too much too soon. To begin a small undertaking will meet with success. The return of the light force is a powerful time indeed, for all the beneficial forces of the Universe will now be exerting their influences in your behalf.`,

        overview: `When we are born, we lack any conscious intention of doing either good or evil. It is only when our deliberate thought process begins that intent develops and innocence can be lost. Intent, by itself, is not harmful. It is only when our intentions are to deliberately hurt another or to act in a manner that is off the path of what is right, just, or good, that misfortune comes to us. In that case, you may as well not attempt anything because it will end either in failure or in a success that you will not enjoy or from which you will ultimately not benefit. If you would seek to influence others, follow the true inclination of your heart. Any deliberate action you take to influence others that does not arise from a sincere desire to benefit them lacks innocence and is therefore manipulative. If we gain loyalty or allegiance through such manipulation, we must continue it afterward, or we will lose the loyalty or allegiance we gained. Such courses of action are emotionally exhausting and always end badly. To attract people naturally and effortlessly, we need only follow the true promptings of our hearts because the Universe has endowed us with a nature that is innately pure and good. The Universe does not provide good fortune or great rewards for those who do not act in accord with what is highest and best within them. If your intentions remain pure and you act without any ulterior thoughts of reward or advantages, you will be living in accord with your original nature. As a result, everything will work to your advantage and will bring supreme success and great good fortune to you. Of such stuff are true leaders made. This kua also depicts the condition of unexpected misfortune. Should that befall you, take heart, for it will ultimately pass away and work to your benefit. Superior persons take every turn of events, no matter how dire, and turn it into good fortune. So sure are they of their ability to do so that they will stake their very life upon it.`,

        overview: `You want to make a forceful and aggressive advance, but someone or something is powerfully holding you back, or you should exert strong restraint on yourself at this time. You will not be serving your best interests if you try to advance now. Instead, wait until the restraining force has dissipated or the need for holding back has ended before making an advance. Do not waste this time of waiting in mere empty hoping, but fill it with useful activities carried out in the certainty that you will reach your goal. Then, when the period of restraint is over, you will be ready to advance. This time of restraint is beneficial in that it gives you an opportunity to cultivate your strengths and good qualities. While you wait, you will benefit from studying the great sayings of antiquity to be found in such books as the two volumes of I Ching Wisdom(Power Press). The words of the great sages have survived for thousands of years because of their great value to the people and for the great wisdom they provide. You can use that wisdom to develop your own character and to gain valuable insights, and this will lead you to great success and good fortune. Only through such daily self - renewal will you be able to continue at the height of your powers. You will benefit from continuing to live according to the highest standards of conduct. The ancient text states that finding some way to enter public service at this time will work to your advantage. You will also benefit if you assist others to earn a living, and, when the period of holding back is past, if you turn your attention to finishing a project that you have started or by beginning a new project.`,

        overview: `This kua offers advice about providing food, financial resources, housing, education, spiritual guidance or information, material matters, and other forms of sustenance to yourself and to others. When you take care of others, do not weaken them with your generosity, for nothing is as powerful as necessity when it comes to strengthening the will and creating a strong work ethic. Avoid depriving others of the benefits of providing for themselves, for unearned wealth always works to destroy us. If you offer opportunities and education to deserving people so they can earn their own livelihood, great benefit will accrue to you and to them. What is more, they in turn will later nourish others and thus society as a whole. Superior people are moderate and temperate in their eating, drinking, and speech. Regarding food, take care to eat a healthy diet, and to eat in moderation. In matters of income, finances, wealth, and other forms of material sustenance, do not permit others to provide for you if you can provide for yourself, for accepting such favors will only weaken and shame you.\nThis is not to say that you should not give or accept gifts, but that you should learn to become strong and independent and teach others to do the same. Wise individuals do not overreach themselves, overspend, or strive needlessly. If you observe the guidance of this kua, you will live long and well, prosper greatly, and be of major benefit to yourself and to others. Great good fortune and success will be yours.`,

        overview: `This kua indicates that you have overused your power or have overindulged in excesses, which has created dangerous imbalances in your situation. These must be corrected immediately if a complete collapse is to be avoided. Everything in its proper measure benefits you, but the same thing, carried to excess, destroys you. The ancient text uses the example of the ridgepole that supports the roof of a house. A ridgepole that is thick and heavy at its center but weak at its ends will give way, and the entire structure will collapse unless immediate measures are taken. Similarly, if you can do anything to curb your overuse of power or reduce the excesses in this situation, do so immediately. However, even though the situation requires extraordinary measures, act gently and avoid using any forceful or aggressive measures, for too much force has already been at issue here. Great power is always best expressed in gentleness. Gaining insight into how to correct the imbalances will require thoughtful, penetrating reflection. Once you attain an inner mastery and understanding of the situation, any gentle action you take to correct it will succeed. If you can obtain help in correcting the excesses, do so. If not, carry on alone and do not lose heart. Maintain your good spirits and peace of mind, for this is a kua of success.`,

        overview: `The danger depicted in this kua is objective, meaning that it stems from an outside source. In most situations, you will be able to avoid the danger if you take appropriate action. However, if it cannot be overcome, you must simply endure it.\nDanger does not always bring disaster nor does it always result in misfortune. The threat of danger has its important use because it sharpens your mind and prepares you to meet and cope with adversity. Danger makes you aware of weaknesses in your life, whether these have to do with our financial or business situation, our philosophical views, our domestic life, our relationships, or our social structure. With proper awareness, we can often avoid danger or even turn it to good use.\nIf you are aware of and understand the danger in this situation, you should inform others so that they too can prepare themselves, for you have a duty to alert them rather than keeping the information to yourself. The ancient text urges you to teach others not just about the danger that now threatens, but also to share with them any spiritual wisdom that you may possess.\nThis kua is known as “The Abyss, ” which refers to a pit. To escape it—to avoid falling into the pit—you must first take every precaution not to be overcome by it, and then act immediately to extricate yourself or eliminate it. If you remain true to your highest and best principles and use your intuition to penetrate to the source of this threat, you will gain inner mastery over it. Once you have done so, any action you take will naturally succeed.`,

And so too must we humans, being spiritual beings, cling to the spiritual essence of the Universe if we are to thrive. This is the kua of brightness, and to maintain the brightness of your essence, your intelligence, reason, clarity, and spirituality, you must refresh yourself every day from the Universal fount of spiritual wisdom. If you do not, your light will grow dim, and you will stray from the path of abundant life, which means that you will continue to live, but not abundantly. Li also represents fire, the sun, and nature in all its great radiance. Like fire, its motion is directed upward. Because this kua is the trigram of Li doubled, it signifies exceptional intelligence, reason, clarity, and spiritual wisdom that will guide you in following the path of what is right, good, and just.\nTo live in the fullness of life, you must follow the rhythms of life, giving and taking, inhaling and exhaling, sleeping and waking, and absorbing spiritual wisdom and giving it out. Be like the apple tree that absorbs nourishment from the earth and freely gives its fruit to all who pass by. If you are to share your light and wisdom, you must first cultivate light and wisdom. Refresh yourself in the springs of wisdom from the oldest teachings that have survived for thousands of years, for, as the ancient text states, “The great man, by perpetuating his brightness, illumines the four quarters of the world.”\nTo complete and perfect your cycle of learning and teaching, share the wisdom you gain. By following the path of the superior person, which is the path of abundant life, you will enjoy good friends, good health, prosperity, peace, harmony, and possessions in great measure, as well as supreme success and great good fortune. But know also that the same Universal law that brings you these gifts will remove them from you if you stray from the path of an honorable life.

If you continue to conduct yourself in ways that are receptive, inviting, modest, and devoid of ulterior motives, you will see your influence grow, and people will be encouraged to approach you. However, if your motives are selfish, dishonest, or fail to stem from an intention to benefit all concerned, misfortune will result, and your relationships will prove so unrewarding that it would be better if you had not met at all.\nIn this time of attraction and influence, you will find it easy to enlist the aid of helpers, or to attract those to whom you are attracted. You need only be openly receptive and encouraging to them. Once you have created those relationships, binding them will bring good fortune. If you are a man who is seeking to attract a woman, avoid acting forcefully or trying to dominate her. Instead, be low - key and yielding in your attitude and behavior.

Whether your question to the oracle concerns personal or business relationships, ownership, conditions, or situations, the answer is that the topic under consideration will have long duration. The second meaning of the kua is perseverance. Because the topic under consideration will have a long life, you must develop a deep reservoir of perseverance that will see you through to the attainment of your goal and will provide you with support in the face of pain, fatigue, frustration, opposition, or hardship, and even during the best of times. Perseverance means to continue to the end. Once you have established the inner condition of perseverance, you will be able to reach your goal, overcome any obstacle, and bear up in any situation. Your perseverance will lead you to success.\nSuperior persons stand firm in the face of changing times and do not permit anything or anyone to deter them from achieving their goals.\nThat does not mean that you should ignore changing conditions or never revise your plans in keeping with such changing conditions. Rather, it means that you should not follow each new, passing fad. Success will come to you if you begin anew at every ending, cultivate long - lasting strengths of character, and develop inner consistency. When you behave according to those principles, others will not find fault with you. Above all, remain true to your inner resolve to follow the path of the superior person. That inner resolve will be the core of your success, for it will be the ground out of which all your actions spring.

However, do not let your withdrawal be rash, abrupt, hasty, or frantic and disorganized.\nInstead, act with caution after you have devised a carefully thought - out plan to remove yourself and your assets from the situation. If you are involved in a conflict, your retreat is not a surrender, but rather a strategic withdrawal that will allow you to replenish your forces, conserve what you have, and develop a new plan that will lead to victory. Avoid exhausting yourself or depleting your assets at this time. Nor should you make any all - out efforts to force your advance, for they will fail. If a person or group wants you to join them, it will be in your best interests to gently extricate yourself from them and the situation, and then to make yourself unavailable to them.

Perhaps your adversary may fear that you will undermine their status or resources, or establish a relationship with someone he or she may not want you to have a relationship with, or accomplish something that they see as potentially damaging or detrimental. Their persecution is an attempt to undermine you and weaken your position so you will not be able to accomplish what they fear. If you are to maintain your position and succeed in attaining your goal during this time of adversity, persevere in what you know to be right, and behave with the utmost discretion in every way. Most importantly, avoid calling attention to your wealth, resources, ability and intelligence, or you will risk antagonizing the adversary further. Continue to follow the path of honor and integrity, and act always from your higher nature rather than your lower. Be modest and unassuming. Avoid claiming credit for your accomplishments, but share your credit with others. Do not abandon your goal unless you believe that you might cause irreparable harm to yourself or to others if you persist. The best way to guarantee your success in this situation is to bide your time; to go about your affairs with the utmost discretion and caution; and to avoid any forceful, aggressive, or extreme behaviors or actions that could arouse resentment or resistance.

Being part of a family or group will enable you to accomplish much more than you can alone and will bring you good fortune. Keep in mind that you should conduct yourself as a person of honor and integrity at all times, not just with members of your family or group, but with everyone. Such behavior will bring honor to your family or group and will also earn you their honor and respect, which is a great credit to you, and one that you should work diligently to obtain. You can achieve that respect by living up to the model of the superior person in every way. Superior people live up to their word, meaning that they do what they say they will do and they always speak the truth. Also, their words and actions are always in harmony, and, if they say that being trustworthy is important, they should always be trustworthy.

Families and groups should establish common traditions and beliefs, meaning that they should agree to continue to uphold honorable principles in common, rather than adopting every passing trend, and that they are loyal and dedicated to all the other members. Internal conflict or dissension weakens the power of families and groups to act as a unit in overcoming external dangers.`,

        overview: `At this time, your friendship or relationship with a person or group has degenerated into unfriendliness, hostility, or alienation. This may be due to something you did or said, or perhaps someone else is instigating it. Most likely, the problem is the result of a misunderstanding.  To correct the misunderstanding, be willing to take the blame, be tolerant of the other side’s feelings, overlook mistakes, and forgive even deliberate violations.\nDo not attempt a major resolution of the situation at this time, because you will meet with failure and only further alienation will result. Only minor gains can be made, or small issues resolved at this time, and you must content yourself with those.\nDo not lose heart.  Remain hopeful and cheerful.  If the relationship is based on a real affinity, it will right itself in time, provided you treat it with careful attention and continue to follow the path of the superior person.`,

        overview: `If you continue on your chosen course of action at this time, you will place yourself in the path of dangerous adversity. Do not confront the danger. Instead, make a cautious retreat, and then develop a different course of action. Be sure to consult the oracle again regarding the new plan before putting it into effect. If you proceed in that way, all occasions for remorse will disappear, and in small matters, you will achieve good fortune. You are acquainted with a qualified person who can offer you useful guidance that will allow you to see a way out of the danger. Your retreat is only temporary, and if you persist in a new course of action and act prudently, you will triumph in the end. To retreat does not mean to give up the battle. On the contrary, retreating preserves resources and allows time to regain strength, renew forces, and make new plans. Thus, retreat makes possible a countermovement, which makes possible your success. Remain true to what is highest and best within you.\nIn general, opposition appears as obstruction, but superior persons use it to their advantage. They use opposition or obstructions to gather strength, cultivate their character, and plan a more productive course of action. Inferior persons, ignorant of the laws of the Universe, react to opposition by bemoaning their fate, blaming circumstances or other people, and giving up in their attempt to reach their goals.`,

Reflect carefully on the entire situation related to your question. If you need to take any further steps to finish abating the danger, attend to those immediately so that there will be no chance of it recurring. Avoid spending too much time deliberating. Once you have considered any matter carefully, anxious hesitation will only cause you to miss your opportunity, for too much reflection cripples the power of decision. After you have reduced or eliminated the danger, return to your normal actions and conditions as quickly as possible.  Only take whatever actions are necessary to reduce or eliminate the danger. To reduce or eliminate the danger that threatens, resolve any open conflicts, settle any existing arguments, forgive mistakes, and pardon even intentional violations. Such actions will lessen any remaining tensions and pave the way for a return to normal conditions. After the danger has completely subsided, you may feel so relieved that you want to celebrate. That is natural, but avoid letting yourself be carried away, for that will work against you. By quickly taking the actions necessary to abate the danger, you will have good fortune.`,

If your question was with regard to the taking of action, taking the action will bring about decrease and therefore should be avoided. If your question is about an existing situation, know that it is or soon will be in a time of decrease. During this time, restrain your anger so that arguments or difficulties will not arise that will further the decrease. During this time of decrease, remain modest and sincere and avoid any outward displays of wealth. Only small accomplishments can be made at this time. Since this is a condition of the time, it will pass away of its own accord. What is important is that you act in accord with this time, attempting only the achievement of lesser goals. Regarding financial matters, security and happiness prevail when you keep income and expenditures in balance. Because all periods of prosperity are followed by periods of decline, the superior person uses prosperous times to prepare for times of decline.\nIf you pretend abundance when you are actually in need, those who could help you will not, either because they believe your pretense of abundance, or because they see through your pretense and therefore find you undeserving. Furthermore, if you pretend to have something when you do not, you will destroy your self - respect.\nAt this time, you will benefit by undertaking a project as well as maintaining the utmost integrity. Take neither gain nor loss to heart. You are not your gain; neither are you your loss. What is important is your reverence for All - That - Is, and your personal philosophy that you are a golden child of an indestructible Universe where everything that happens benefits you. Having that personal philosophy permits you to maintain happiness in the face of decrease. The decrease that you are now experiencing or will soon experience is only a phase that will soon turn to a time of increase. What matters is that, during this time of decrease, you seek to improve yourself in whatever ways you can, so that when this time of decrease is over, you will be prepared to take advantage of the time of increase and will thereby maximize its full potential.\nThis time of decrease is great indeed and brings good fortune to you, but only if you use your time effectively to prepare for the time of increase that always follows.

Your plans will be assisted, you will be helped to achieve your goals, and your efforts will be rewarded with increase and gain.\nHowever, for you to achieve these things, you must take active steps to accomplish your goal. You cannot sit back and wait for success to drop into your lap. In this time of increase, you will be benefited by far - reaching ideas. Keep in mind that, if the increase and gain of this time are to be great, they must benefit others as well as yourself.\nThe ancient text also states that when you see good in another, you should imitate it, and when you find faults within yourself, you should correct them immediately. Those are two of the most important character attributes you can cultivate, and persevering in them will lead to great good fortune and success. \nFurthermore, if you persevere along that path, even among the lucky, you will stand out as the chosen one.

Whichever is the case, the lines are an unstoppable force that will mount upward and overthrow the broken top line, which usually represents an evil person, a group, a destructive habit, a disruptive family member, an opposition faction within a group, or some other dark entity. Although the dark force represented by the top line appears weak, it is not. Its dark force destroys and undermines slowly and treacherously, and because it is at the top of the kua, it is powerful and in a controlling position.\nThe situation is dangerous, and you must take great care in dealing with this force, whatever or whoever it is. The ultimate outcome is not in doubt because the five lower lines are far too strong to be stopped by the one weak, broken line at the top. However, the overthrow must be accomplished in the right way because, if you resort to evil methods, you will become an ally and an instrument of evil, and the overthrow will become that much more difficult. It is a Universal law that evil or dishonest tactics will always rebound against you. If you continue to follow the path of utmost integrity, you will not give the dark force any weapons to use against you. Under no circumstances should you resort to force, for that too will only work against you. The most powerful way to fight evil is always to do good. The evil entity must be openly discredited and denounced, and everyone involved or affected by the overthrow must be informed of the plan. Finally, your overthrow must be complete, or else the dark force will rise again to cause harm to you and to those around you.\nDuring times when dark forces are being overthrown, you should help those below you with your resources and assistance. To provide that assistance now will benefit you. Nor should you be content with yesterday’s honors, but you should constantly press on to ever - greater achievements. It will benefit you at this time to undertake a project. If you follow the counsel offered here, you will succeed in overthrowing the dark force, and great acclaim and rewards will be yours.`,

Be careful and do not ally or associate with her in any way, however unthreatening and alluring she appears.\nShe will use her harmless appearance to tempt you into dropping your defenses so she can seize control of the situation and cause you great harm.\nIf the dark force is a man, he may appear good - natured and harmless, but he is not. On the contrary, he is powerful and bent on bringing harm to you and those in your circle. Do not give him any power or associate with him in any way whatsoever. Do not be deluded into thinking that, because he appears harmless, you can safely spend time with him, because that is how he obtains influence and finds opportunities to cause you harm. Resist him from the outset.\nThis is a dangerous time for you and for everyone around you. To counteract the dark force, you should develop a plan to protect yourself, your family, group, or organization. Alert everyone about the dark force and warn them of its potential for harm. Take appropriate steps and precautions to neutralize the danger in this crucial time. If the dark force gains even a toehold, it will quickly grow to alarming proportions.

If you are joining a group, you should have a clear understanding of why you are joining and what you hope to accomplish. The group will have its own goals and reasons for its existence, but you must be clear about your own personal goal or what you want to obtain for yourself by joining. If you are creating a group, you must have a well - defined cause that will draw all the members together and earn their support. To attract followers, you must be enthusiastic about your goal, so that you will gain their interest and ignite their own enthusiasm. The goal must be meaningful and worthwhile, or your members will soon drop out.\nBeing the leader of a group requires sincerity, strength, and dedication to the group’s well - being. Your motives for creating a group must be ethical, moral, and rooted in an inner desire not just to meet your own needs but to be of service to the members and to those outside the group. There is some indication that you can gain valuable information about your undertaking by seeking advice from a qualified person before you begin. Once you define your goal and develop clearcut guidelines for achieving it, you must always move in the direction of your goal. Your followers will rely on you to set an example, so you will have to show them that you are tireless, dedicated, enthusiastic, and loyal.\nWhether you are joining or creating a group, choose your associates with great care. Universal forces are at work bringing together those who belong together. At this time, the Universal forces may bring people to you who may not be to your personal liking but who nonetheless will be of great benefit to you or to the group. According to the ancient text, you should remain open - minded when you are either talking with members of a group you are considering joining or talking with potential members of the group you are forming. You need not concern yourself about finding the right people, for they will come. The ancient text also states that you can obtain good fortune by making a great offering. The ancient text urges you to prepare for the unexpected and to take whatever precautions you can to ward off any dangers that might arise.

Even the greatest and most difficult goals can be achieved if we break them down into simple, easy steps.\nFor example, we may have trouble envisioning an entire year, but if we divide it into months, then days, and then hours, it stops feeling overwhelming.\nTo contemplate an entire trek up a great mountain is daunting; however, one step up the mountain is easy to take, and so follow the rest of the steps until the summit is reached. Instead of feeling discouraged or overwhelmed, it is best to divide great goals into small, easily handled tasks that we can carry out one step at a time. Do not waste energy thinking about the outcome. Simply begin and then continue to the end, one step at a time.\nDuring this time of action, it is essential that you seek help and guidance from a qualified person. You need not be fearful, for a successful outcome is certain. Being loyal and devoted will benefit you.

You should be so certain of your ability to turn adversity into good fortune that you will stake your very life on your conviction.

To see each of those instances for what they are, opportunities for growth and improvement, is the way of the sage. Seeing them in that light will bring an amazing change in your outlook, for you will then see all obstacles and adversities as opportunities, and you will consequently lose your resentment of them.`,

That is how you will see the right moment for action and make no mistake. The Universal law that provides for constant change is the only thing that does not change, so to remain inflexible when all else is changing is to invite disaster. Rigidity leads to failure, but flexibility leads to success. Nonetheless, it is equally crucial for your success that you set a firm course and that your character is steady enough that you do not give in to and follow every passing fad or trend.\nWhen the time for action is at hand, you will inspire the confidence of those who will assist you in bringing the change about by maintaining a positive and enthusiastic attitude. Motivate everyone to support your cause so that they can get behind you and offer their help. During this period, you will find it easy to enlist helpers, and your enthusiasm will carry you and them through to the end. You must cultivate endurance if you hope to attain your goal. It is important to make a plan and follow it carefully. Also, to achieve the change, you must have the best interests of everyone at heart, for, if your goals are selfish, your plans will lack greatness and will therefore come to nothing. This time is great, but only greatness of spirit will achieve a great ending. If you persist in following the path of utmost integrity and greatheartedness, you will achieve supreme success.

All events, even those that cause us injury or deprive us of something, benefit us.\nDisaster is a tap on the shoulder from the Universe, which brings about earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, tidal waves, financial upsets, great losses, personal traumas, and emotional shocks as well as other terrifying situations and events. Such cataclysms remind us that the Universe is not only aweinspiring but also sometimes terrifying. When such events occur, wise individuals are awed by them and use them as opportunities to examine their lives, to study whether their affairs are in order, and to reflect on whether they are living the life of the superior person. That is one of the great values of such events, for we can then order our lives according to the highest principles. The time of shock is truly great.\nIn this situation, if the shock has not yet arrived, and you want to prevent it from taking place, do not pursue the issue or matter in question further at this time.

This is the time for stopping, so, with regard to your question, stop and take no further action at this time. To do otherwise will lead to misfortune. There are times when the best action is no action, and this is one of those times.\nDuring this time of stopping, learn to quiet your heart and your inner being. Open yourself to the subtle inner promptings of the Universe, and know that everything is as it should be. The Universe is preparing the way for you to achieve what is in your best interests. Do not try to hurry this process, but be relaxed and confident. You have not been forgotten but are held at every moment in the great awareness. To achieve a quiet heart, rest and movement must follow each other in accordance with the demands of the time. If you have a quiet heart, you will be sensitive to the subtle promptings that come to you from the world around you, and this, in turn, will allow you to move effortlessly and smoothly through life, rather than blundering through it with great effort and difficulty. Acting in accord with the demands of the time always leads to harmony.\nIf you persist in remaining in motion during the time for rest, you will be unprepared when the time for action comes. On the other hand, if you remain still when the time for action comes, you will miss your opportunity, and what would have been easy to achieve will become difficult. The superior person first achieves a quiet heart, and then acts. Anyone who acts from these deep levels makes no mistakes.  Meditation and concentration are good examples of trying to obtain by force what can be obtained only by calmness and relaxation. Using force will produce results opposite from those intended. Achieving inner composure first allows meditation and concentration to develop naturally and thereby produces the desired result. The symbol of this kua is the mountain.

Because gradual development requires a long time, perseverance is required so that the develpment continues without ever stopping altogether.\nThe ancient text refers to the time when a maiden is given in marriage. It uses the flight of a wild goose as a symbol to depict the stages of development because the wild goose has only one mate in its lifetime and thus represents fidelity, trust, truthfulness, and loyalty—the essential attributes of every successful marriage, partnership, and relationship of any kind. No matter what close relationship is being formed, observing all the formalities in their proper order, just as a marriage proceeds from courtship to proposal to consummation, will bring success.\nGradual development pertains to all relationships or situations that are in the process of becoming established over time. Thoughtfulness, attention to detail, avoiding any violations of the bounds of social correctness, and never trying to hurry the development unnaturally will all bring success and good fortune. The object of your concern is in the process of gradual development and will thus progress slowly but continually, provided that you give it your attention. Similarly, if you are contemplating making a change in a relationship, carry it out gradually, not abruptly. It will be to your advantage to act with the utmost integrity during this time of gradual development, for that will set a good example for others. Also, during this time of gradual development, pay attention to the cultivation of your own character as well, for that is the key to a prosperous and peaceful future.

It could be a personal or love relationship, a partnership, a company, organization, a family, or any other type of group. In all cases, the situation is unfavorable because weak people have strong positions of influence and feel threatened by you. With regard to a personal or love relationship, maintaining it or entering into it requires that you be modest and gentle because aggressiveness on your part will arouse resentment and resistance either from the person with whom you want to have the relationship or those close to that person. Those close to the person will try to undermine you, either to protect the person from you or to protect their own relationship with that person. With regard to a group to which you already belong or which you would like to join, aggressiveness on your part will arouse resentment and resistance from some members. You must be able to fit yourself in smoothly without arousing anger, suspicion, fear, or distrust. Those already in the group are possessive of their positions and influence, and if you threaten them in any way, it will work to your disadvantage.\nRelationships that are legally formed have a contract as a basis for conduct, but relationships based on voluntary participation require great tact and thoughtfulness if you are to successfully maintain or integrate yourself into the relationship or group. To be successful in your endeavor, you must exercise great caution, be willing to do more than your share, remain exceptionally modest, unobtrusive, friendly, open, and inviting, downplay your talent, good looks, and assets, and be careful not to threaten anyone’s position. In that way, you will have the best chance of attaining your goal. However, it is a difficult situation. Neither good fortune nor misfortune is indicated by this kua because your success is entirely dependent on how you conduct yourself and how the members or the person receives you.`,

        overview: `You have brought about or will bring about a time of maximum abundance. When anything reaches its maximum potential, it inevitably turns toward its opposite. Such changes are a product of the time and a function of Universal law, and there is no avoiding them. This is not to say that your abundance will not continue, but rather that you cannot increase it without running the risk of turning this time of abundance into a time of decrease. The best you can hope for is to prolong your abundance. Enjoy this time of success while it lasts. Resolve any unsettled disputes, and exact any unfulfilled penalties. This kua cautions you to remain modest and vigilant once you have acquired your treasure, whatever it is. Otherwise, the same Universal law that bestowed it upon you will remove it from you or cause it to work to your detriment. Do not delude yourself that your achievements, titles, and possessions are the totality or the be - all and end - all of life. They are merely the objects you have chosen to lead yourself along the path of life. Rather, it is the path itself that is the be - all and end - all of life, for it is on that path that you will learn the lessons of life and perfect yourself as a divine being in a perfect Universe.`,

        desc: 'The Wanderer, The Traveler',
        overview: `This kua depicts a traveler or wanderer whose stay is of short duration. Thus, only limited progress can be made. At this time, do not try to accomplish lofty goals or goals that require perseverance, for you or the person or situation at issue will not tarry long. If your question concerns your own situation, you are in a transitional state and will experience a change of some kind in the near future. If you are to make even the small progress possible under those changing conditions, you must conduct yourself with reserve, honor, and modesty. Refrain as well from forceful or aggressive behavior. Should any disputes arise, settle them quickly by meeting your adversary more than halfway, and be cautious when demanding restitution. Should you find yourself involved in a lawsuit, settle it quickly. Under no circumstances should you permit it to drag on, or you will suffer misfortune. If you travel to new places, be on your most courteous, cordial, best behavior, while avoiding all confrontation. Avoid arrogance as well.\nDuring the time of traveling or wandering, do all the good you can so that, when you move on, those you have met or dealt with will speak well of you. If your question concerns a current situation, it will pass quickly and another situation will replace it.\nThe action you take regarding the current situation will shape the one that follows. If your question concerns a person, he or she will soon leave the situation. If your question concerns a condition or state of affairs, it will soon pass and evolve into a new condition. If you have obtained this as your second kua, the person, situation, or condition will move on, but not until some time has passed.`,

        desc: 'Gently Penetrating',
        overview: `The kua represents gentleness and ceaseless penetration into the consciousness of others so that you may influence them. It also represents the power of your mind to penetrate into the dark recesses where conspiracies and intrigues live, and to expose them to the light, where they can be dissolved. In addition, it represents your clarity of judgment, which allows you to reach decisions that will benefit you and protect you from being harmed by others’ schemes or intrigues. The image is the gentle but ceaselessly penetrating wind. Because this kua is formed of the trigram Sun doubled, it means two winds, or wind following wind. The first wind penetrates into the situation and disperses negative or evil influences in the minds of those you wish to influence. The second wind penetrates into their consciousness and changes their attitudes so they will follow you willingly and help you to achieve your goals. You can help bring these changes about by repeating your orders or commands gently but consistently and by giving them a clear vision of your goal. If you try to use force, or if your manner is harsh or abrasive, you will fail to bring about the harmonious changes you are seeking, and their change in attitude will fade quickly.\nYour goal is to create willingness and enthusiasm, not to bully those you wish to influence into reluctant or unwilling obedience. If you communicate your message gently, you will arouse neither resentment nor resistance. To do this, your message must be clear and grounded in ethical, moral intentions. It will be of great benefit if you are also patient and persevering. At this time, you will benefit by setting out to accomplish a goal of some kind. The ancient text suggests that you should seek the counsel of a qualified person before you begin, and as the work progresses. If you work for someone else or are working on someone else ’s behalf, you will do well to broadly communicate his or her wishes to others gently, but always consistently. Keep your goal in mind at all times. In this kua, success comes through taking small steps: achieving minor goals, paying attention to minor details, using minor players, and practicing modesty.`,

        desc: 'Joyousness, Pleasure',
        overview: `This kua is made up of the trigram for “Lake” doubled. Because the lake symbolizes joy, the kua represents lake feeding lake, or joy replenishing joy. The main difference between joy and pleasure is that joy comes from within, while pleasure comes from outside stimulation. Joy stems from powerful feelings of contentment and well - being, while pleasure stems from mental or physical sense gratifications. This kua shows that joy springs from inner strength and from following an honorable path, while pleasure, carried to extremes, can cause you harm.\nIf your question concerns a relationship, the indication is that the two of you will provide each other with joy. To maintain that joy, cultivate affection, consideration, and respect as the primary basis of your relationship. Focus your attention on having the relationship endure. Joy shared is joy doubled. The image of mutual joy leads to the idea of people gathering together to discuss the great truths of life and thereby expanding each other’s ideas and conceptions about its wonder.\nSuccess and good fortune lie ahead, so you should be joyous of heart but also serious - minded. Superior persons are always serious - minded at some level because they know that all periods of prosperity are followed by times of decline, and that all people are not as they should be. They therefore take thought for the future and exercise caution in their dealings with others. Nonetheless, no matter how serious or weighty their thoughts, those concerns never dim the inner joy they feel because of their continual awareness that they are indestructible children of the wonder - filled Universe of which they are an inseparable part. By following the guidance of this kua, you will meet with success.`,

        overview: `This indicates that a dangerous situation exists that you can resolve by identifying the danger and acting to gently dissolve or remove the dangerous elements. The source of the danger is disunity and a lack of harmony among those who should be unified and cooperating with you to achieve a common goal. If there is a lack of enthusiasm and dedication to a common goal, creating and maintaining unity will be difficult.\nTo obtain help in identifying the heart of the problem and in arriving at ways to remove the danger requires that you seek the guidance of the Universe in whatever way is appropriate for you, such as again inquiring of the oracle to obtain a deeper understanding of the problem. Speaking with the people involved will help you to learn what is keeping apart those who should be working together with you. If you make yourself a focal point, provide a common goal around which everyone can rally, and generate enthusiasm, as well as dissolving enmity, anger, hostility, and hatred, you will defeat the dangerous elements that are blocking unity. You can succeed in dissolving even the greatest danger, provided you persevere in searching for its source and in seeking ways to dissolve it. Success is certain.`,

        desc: 'Setting Limitiations',
        overview: `The meaning of this kua is moderation. If life consisted of unlimited possibilities, it would only dissolve into the boundless. Just to consider every possibility would take all of eternity. Limitations are difficult to impose, particularly on yourself, but they are essential as well as effective.  If you wish to truly enjoy the rewards of the life of a superior person, you must limit and regulate your activities, your thoughts, your associations, your relationships, your eating, your drinking, your sleeping, your work, your play, your accumulating, your spending—in fact, every aspect of your life. Everything in moderation benefits you; the same thing, carried to excess, will destroy you. Your goal is to set proper limits within which you will have total freedom. Because moderation in all things brings success, this kua also cautions you to moderate even your moderation, Do not impose such strict limitations that the limitations become excessive and damage you or others. You would also do well to set limits on your time and your tasks by dividing them into smaller segments so you can grasp and manage them more easily. It is essential that you define for yourself the kind of life you want to have and the best ways to achieve it, while using limitation to avoid excesses. Create a clear idea of the conduct you aspire to and the positive character traits you want to develop.`,

        desc: 'Emptiness, Openness',
        overview: `In this kua, two broken lines in the center of four solid lines represent emptiness. This is a time for you to be clear about your goals and about making decisions regarding others. The way in which you can achieve that clarity is by emptying your mind of all prejudiced thoughts, foregone conclusions, or conscious expectations. Let your mind be open, receptive, and free of preconceived ideas. Once you achieve that state of emptiness, you will be open to receiving wisdom and knowledge from other sources such as people, objects, books, and the Universe itself. It will be as if you have opened your pure mind—the mind you were born with—and are welcoming in infor - mation, knowledge, and wisdom. That openness will make it possible for you to perceive the state of mind of others. Your understanding of them will increase, and your ability to inspire them to follow you and to do your bidding will increase.\nIf you cultivate open - mindedness, you will earn the respect of all around you. You will also often find solutions that might otherwise escape you, and you will seldom make errors of judgment. Because you have opened your mind to vast sources of knowledge and information, you will speak words of such great wisdom that you will influence not only all those around you but also, as the ancient text states, “the pigs and fishes, ” which is a comical way of saying that you will influence even those who are hard to influence.\nPracticing the pursuit of emptiness will bring you good fortune, and your perceptions will bloom like flowers during a perfect summer. Your inner clarity will make it possible for you to discuss difficult problems and to resolve them. You will benefit from undertaking a major project at this time, and it will bring you good fortune.`,

        overview: `At this time, success lies not in reaching for lofty goals but in being content with small achievements meticulously carried out. This is a time when great modesty and conscientiousness will be well rewarded. Great good fortune can now be yours if you pay strict attention to minor details, aim for lesser goals, and guard against any extremes of behavior.  In your spending, be thrifty, but avoid being stingy; if you lose someone in death, or learn of someone’s great misfortune, grieve sincerely but avoid outward displays meant to impress others; in your conduct, be modest and avoid flattering others. In this time of attention to detail, an accumulation of many small goals will result in your achieving a major goal.`,

        overview: `This is the only kua in the I Ching in which all the lines are in their proper places: strong lines are in strong places, and weak lines are in weak places. Perfect order has been accomplished, inner and outer harmony prevail, and perfect position and balance have been achieved. That is the condition surrounding your question. Your future looks bright and prosperous. However, it is only after perfect balance has been achieved that any misstep brings imbalance.\nThe ancient text states, “No plain not followed by a slope, no increase not followed by a decrease. ” It is an eternal law of the Universe that everything turns toward its opposite as soon as it reaches its maximum potential: fullness to emptiness, light to dark, abundance to lack. Knowing that law, superior persons make provisions for a time of decrease in times of prosperity. In times of good health, they build themselves up, and so prepare against a time of illness. In times of safety, they take precautions that protect them in times of danger. They think ahead, so they are always prepared. They therefore enjoy a lifetime of good fortune and success.\nThis kua cautions you to pay close attention to details and to remain modest and alert now that you have acquired your treasure, whatever it is. Otherwise, the same law that brought it to you will take it away or will cause it to work against you.\nSuperior persons remain aware of the danger and do all they can to continue the order and balance as long as possible.  You can prolong this time of perfect order by being vigilant and persevering and by paying attention to finishing the final details of your plan or situation.`,

        overview: `You have almost achieved success. The lines of this kua, each of which represents your current condition, are in order because the broken and solid lines follow each other as they are supposed to. However, all of the lines are in spaces that are inappropriate for them; the broken lines are in strong spaces, and the solid lines are in weak places. The same is true for your own situation: everything is in order, but out of place. Whatever is out of place, whether it be a person, a group, a system, an object, or a process, is complete in every detail and is on the verge of success, but it is not performing the function for which it was intended or else is not in the correct position. Something is wrong with the situation. Therefore, it functions, but not efficiently or at its full potential. Fortunately, it is only one step away from its proper place or its proper use. That means that complete success is close, but so is danger, because further misplacement will result if extreme caution and good judgment are not exercised. The ancient text uses the example of a fox stepping on stones to cross a wide stream. After nearly completing his crossing, he slips, and his tail falls into the water. You, too, should be extremely cautious as you near your goal. Move toward the accomplishment of your goal cautiously but with confidence because the pronouncement of this kua is success.`,
